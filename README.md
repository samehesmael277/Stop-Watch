## Overview

Stop Watch is an Android app built with Kotlin, developed as a task during my internship at InternSavy. It's a simple and intuitive stop watch application with a timer and three buttons (start, stop, reset). The app utilizes MVVM architecture with ViewModel and LiveData for seamless functionality. The lottie animation library is used to start animation when the timer starts and stop when the timer is stopped. Additionally, ViewBinding and the Intuit library.

## Features

- **Timer Functionality:** Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch timer.
- **Lottie Animation:** Engaging animation starts when the timer is running and stops when paused.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Follows MVVM architecture with ViewModel and LiveData for efficient data flow.
- **Coroutines:** Utilizes Kotlin Coroutines for managing background tasks.
